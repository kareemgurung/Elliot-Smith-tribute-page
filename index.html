                <h3>
                    Here is the time of his life:
                </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1969</strong> - Elliott Smith was born to Gary Smith and Bunny Berryman. At the time of his
                        birth, Gary was a student at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, while Bunny was an elementary
                        school teacher.</li>
                    <li><strong>1979</strong> - He began playing the piano from a young age and learned guitar by the time he
                        was 10. He also began to compose original songs and played one piece at an arts festival which won him a
                        prize.</li>
                    <li><strong>1991</strong> - He attended Hampshire College in Massachusetts and graduated in 1991 with a
                        degree in philosophy and political science. And he formed a band named "Heatmiser"</li>
                    <li><strong>1992</strong> - The band released an Extended Play (EP) of six demo songs. It was a limited
                        version series and some of the songs from the EP were later re-recorded for Heatmiser’s future album.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>1993</strong> - Heatmiser released its first album, ‘Dead Air’. Their music was a contrast of
                        happy and cheerful songs, along with sad and melancholy singles. Their first album featured the single
                        ‘Still’ by Elliott.</li>
                    <li><strong>1994</strong> - The band released an (EP) titled ‘Yellow No.5’. The EP was appreciated by music
                        critics for having a varied and fresh approach. The same year their second album, ‘Cop and Speeder’ was
                        also out. The band was doing fine, but not well enough to support the band mates financially. Elliott
                        did odd jobs also to earn his living. He started exploring a solo career. He brought out his first album
                        as a solo artist which was titled ‘Roman Candle’. The album was well received and was credited to be
                        honest and heartbreaking. Many of Elliott’s songs reflected the pain of his difficult childhood.He
                        started giving solo performances and the indie musician Mary Lou Lord requested him to open for her on
                        an U.S. trip. He toured a lot during that year to promote his solo career.</li>
                    <li><strong>1995</strong> - Prompted by the success of his debut solo album, Elliott released his second
                        album, the self-titled ‘Elliott Smith’. It featured dark songs with minimum background music.</li>
                    <li><strong>1996</strong> - Heatmiser released its last album, ‘Mic City Sons’. It had a decidedly pop feel,
                        and was appreciated for its diversity in songs. Tension was building among the band members, and the
                        band broke up prior to the release of their last album.</li>
                    <li><strong>1997</strong> - In his 1997 album, ‘Either/Or’, he performed on multiple instruments. A music
                        review quoted the songs as his “best ever”. Even though he was finding much fame and success, he also
                        began suffering from depression and alcoholism during this time. He wrote the lyrics and composed the
                        music for the song ‘Miss Misery’ which was recorded in 1997 and featured in the soundtrack of the hit
                        movie ‘Good Will Hunting’. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Song.</li>
                    <li><strong>1998 and later</strong> - In spite of his professional success, he became very depressed and
                        talked of committing suicide. He released two more albums over his lifetime: ‘XO’ (1998) and ‘Figure 8’
                        (2000). Both albums did well.</li>
                    <li><strong>2003</strong> - He led a very troubled personal life and battled with depression, drug addiction
                        and alcoholism. He attempted rehab many times but that did not work for him. On his own accord, he gave
                        up alcohol and psychiatric medications in 2003. On 21 October 2003, he committed suicide by stabbing
                        himself in the chest. He was just 34.</li>

                            is and I don't think anybody does."</strong>
